## Notes for Implementation
1. All SCORM integration points are marked with "SCORM INTEGRATION POINT" comments
2. The example file scorm-integration-points.js shows how these could be implemented
3. The site works as a standalone website without any SCORM implementation
4. All pages include the necessary hooks for session tracking
5. The assessment includes a scoring system that can be integrated with SCORM reporting

## Key Integration Points
1. **Course Initialization**: At the beginning of each HTML file
2. **Lesson Tracking**: In lessons.html for tracking lesson completion
3. **Budget Simulator Tracking**: In budget.html for tracking simulator usage
4. **Assessment Navigation**: In farm-budget-assessment.html for tracking progress
5. **Student Information**: In farm-budget-assessment.html for collecting student data
6. **Assessment Submission**: In farm-budget-assessment.html for reporting scores
7. **Session Management**: In all HTML files for handling page unload events

## Technical Requirements
- The SCORM package should support both SCORM 1.2 and SCORM 2004 if possible
- The package should maintain all responsive design features when loaded in an LMS
- Bookmarking should allow students to resume where they left off
- Assessment scores should be reported to the LMS gradebook
- Student progress should be tracked across all components
